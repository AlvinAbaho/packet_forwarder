# Packet Forwarder

Packet forwarder to make the link between a LoRa concentrator and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org)'s backend.

This packet forwarder **isn't destined** to [The Things Gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/gateway/)'s users, but for users who **already have a gateway** from another vendor, and that want to connect it to The Things Network.

## <a name="install"></a>Install

Installation manuals are available for main available gateways:

+ [Kerlink IoT Station installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/KERLINK.md)
+ [Multitech Conduit installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/MULTITECH.md)
+ [Raspberry Pi + IMST ic880a installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/IMST_RPI.md)

## <a name="build"></a>Build

If you have a custom-made gateway, or if you want to contribute to the development of the packet forwarder, you will have to build the binary yourself.

### <a name="run"></a>Run

```bash
$ packet-forwarder configure
$ packet-forwarder start
```

#### Configuration format and flags

The configuration file generated by `packet-forwarder configure` is stored at `$HOME/.pktfwd.yml`. You can specify a different config file with the `--config` flag, or specify runtime parameters with the different flags:

* `--id`: Gateway ID of the present gateway.
* `--key`: Gateway key of the present gateway.
* `--router`: ID of the router with which communicate (optional ; default: account server-stored router)
* `--auth-server`: URI of the account server (optional ; default: `https://account.thethingsnetwork.org`)
* `--discovery-server`: Address and port of the discovery server (optional ; default: `discover.thethingsnetwork.org:1900`)
* `--verbose` or `-v`: Show debugging information (optional)
* `--downlink-send-margin`: Change downlink send margin, in milliseconds (optional ; [see documentation](docs/IMPLEMENTATION/DOWNLINKS.md))
* `--ignore-crc`: Ignore CRC check, and send uplink packets upstream even if they are CRC-invalid.
* `--reset-pin`: Set a BCM pin number, that will be reset before starting the concentrator (for Raspberry Pi setups)


##### Elasticsearch configuration

You can configure the packet forwarder so that it sends logs to Elasticsearch:

* `--elasticsearch.enable`: Enable Elasticsearch
* `--elasticsearch.address`: Address of a Elasticsearch endpoint (optional ; default: `http://localhost:9200`, as a local cluster)
* `--elasticsearch.prefix`: Prefix of the Elasticsearch index (optional ; default: `packet-forwarder`). There is one Elasticsearch index per day - so if today is July 10th 2017, the logs will be sent to the `{prefix}-2017.07.10` index.
* `--elasticsearch.username`: Elasticsearch username (optional)
* `--elasticsearch.password`: Elasticsearch password (optional)

##### GPS configuration

You can configure a GPS for the packet forwarder in two different manners:

* With the GPS connected as a serial port: by setting `--gps-path`.
* With `gpsd`, by adding `--gpsd.enable`. You can specify the address of `gpsd` with `--gpsd.address`. `gpsd` has priority over the serial port.
